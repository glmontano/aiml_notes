# 1.1 Deep Learning and History - Part 1

- Used for image recognition
- Creates videos and photographs
- They are complex mechanisms, with complex techniques
- One example of complex structures include the microprocessor with logical cates (AND/OR gates)
- Another example is the brain made up of ~86BB neurons. Neurons are considered to be what makes humans intelligent, and scientists attempted to investigate neurons and see if it could be replicated.
- The fundametal building block of a neuron is called the Perceptron.

# 1.2 Deep Learning and History - Part 2

- Perceptron was first written in 1940 by McCulloch-Pitts
- McCulloch modelled the neuron by considering the Perceptron as a function that sums the binary inputs, before seeing whether its above some threshold. Therefore, the Perceptron is a step function. It may be of the form
  - If Sum(xi) >= T, then output 1
  - If Sum(xi) < T, then output 0

- Some inputs, however, are called inhibitary inputs. If they take a value of 1, then the output will be 0.

- In 1958 Rsonblatt created another model, and is considered to be the ongoing model that we use today.
